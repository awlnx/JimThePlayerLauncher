            <h1> Bipass </h1>
            <p> Normally Jim will try to pull the video url out of the player
            <p> Add domains here that you want the player to try to open directly instead. useful for players like mpv or vlc which have built in support for sites like youtube and twitch. These sites have special encoding Jim won't be able to open them correctly otherwise</p>
